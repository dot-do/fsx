 * **Standard events (create, modify, delete):**
 * ```typescript
 * createWatchEvent('create', '/path/to/file', { size: 1024 })
 * createWatchEvent('modify', '/path/to/file', { size: 2048, mtime: Date.now() })
 * createWatchEvent('delete', '/path/to/file')

 * **Rename events:**
 * ```typescript
 * createWatchEvent('rename', '/old/path', '/new/path', { size: 512 })
 * ```
 *
 * @param type - The type of filesystem change
 * @param path - The file path. For rename events, this is the OLD path.
 * @param newPathOrMetadata - For rename events: the NEW path. For other events: optional metadata.
 * @param metadata - For rename events only: optional metadata about the renamed file.
 * @returns A WatchEvent object with timestamp and any provided metadata
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Create event with full metadata
 * const event = createWatchEvent('create', '/data/file.json', {
 *   size: 1024,
 *   mtime: Date.now(),
 *   isDirectory: false,
